<p class="center-align"><b>Hi there!</b> This is a simple site that makes it possible to vote for an important question: Who is better: Batman or Superman?<br/>
You can fill out the following and form and watch whom others vote for in real time. You can only vote once, so think about your choice wisely :)<br/>
    <small>By the way this site was built for the event Google IO Extended 2015 for demonstration purposes, but I thought people would be interested in it so I made it public.</small>
